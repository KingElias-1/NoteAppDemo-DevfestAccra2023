# Note App with Android x Firebase

Welcome to the Note App repository! This Android app is a simple note-taking application that demonstrates the integration of Android with Firebase for real-time data storage.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations:** Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on notes.
- **Firebase Integration:** Utilizes Firebase Realtime Database for real-time synchronization of notes across devices.
- **Android Architecture Components:** Implements ViewModel, LiveData, and other Android Architecture Components for a robust and maintainable architecture.
